Email Is Back
==========

Email is the most open and widely used communication protocol ever created. There are over 2.5 billion people using email. Email is decentralized by design- it fosters openess and connection, but also can be configured to be highly private and personal.

Emailisback.com is a website dedicated to celebrating emails strengths, discussing exciting new developments in the email space, a directory of resources, and suggestions for improving emails weak points!
